An awestomate is anyone living with a stoma or supporting someone living with a stoma.

Most people with a stoma have had to fight (and win) a battle of a lifetime, sometimes fighting chronic illnesses for years before finally being able to get on the other side of that part of their journey, only to be faced with a new appendage that they aren't sure where to get more support dealing with. This is where the community resources available here at awestomates.com fits in!

We want to help awesome people like you through every step of this journey and give you the opportunity to reach out to people who've been there!
